# flash-drive

A Flutter app ( my first ! ) to make a simple `flash` card like app to learn languages or just study any subject.

Select a `txt` file containing comma separated phrase pairs from your phone's disk or connected online drive(s) to turn them into `Tinder` like swipeable flash cards.
